# Billion Count Benchmark

A simple project to measure and compare the time it takes for various programming languages to count to one billion (1,000,000,000).

## Results

Execution times were measured on a specific machine. **Your results will vary** based on your hardware (CPU, RAM) and software (OS, compiler/runtime version) environment.

| Language          | Time (seconds) | Compiler / Runtime Version | Notes                       |
| :---------------- | :------------: | :------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Python 3          |     *47.741s* | `Python 3.13.5 | |

*These are example results. Please run the benchmarks on your own system to get accurate data.*
